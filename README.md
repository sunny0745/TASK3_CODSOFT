# TASK3_CODSOFT
Iris_Flower_Classification
## Author: Sunny Singh 

## Domain : Data Science

## Aim
Data Collection:

Utilize the Iris flower dataset, a well-known dataset for classification tasks.
The dataset contains measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for each Iris flower sample.
Data Preprocessing:

Inspect and handle any missing or inconsistent data.
Split the dataset into features (sepal and petal measurements) and target labels (species).
Encode categorical labels into numerical values if necessary.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Understand the distribution of measurements for each species.
Visualize relationships between different features.
Identify any patterns or trends that may aid in model development.
Model Development:

Choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm for classification.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.
Train the model using the training set.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model's performance using the testing set.
Utilize metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Adjust hyperparameters if necessary for better performance.
Visualization:

Visualize the decision boundaries of the model to understand how it separates different species based on measurements.
Model Deployment:

Once satisfied with the model's performance, deploy it for making predictions on new, unseen data.
